                NTH’s mission is to provide quality education through online platform all over the Nepal. We
                enable anyone anywhere at any time to participate in these educational courses. We
                consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable educational content to our
                users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, us and our student
                and instructor community. These Terms apply to all your activities on the NTH website, our
                APIs and other related services.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you involve on NTH platform, you must also agree to the <a href="instructor_terms_and_condition.html" target="_blank"> Instructor Agreement </a>. We also
                provide details regarding our processing of personal data of our students and instructors in
                our <a href="privacy_policy.html" target="_blank">Privacy Policy </a>.

            <p>
               <b class="bold-paragraph"> If you live in the Nepal, by agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve
                   disputes
                with NTH through binding arbitration (with very limited exceptions, not in court), and
                you waive certain rights to participate in class actions. </b>

            <h3 class="text-heading">1. Accounts/Khata</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
                You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and enroll in
                a course. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to
                provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have
                complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account,
                including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your
                account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password.
                You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without
                their permission. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you share your account login credential with someone else, you are responsible for what
                happens with your account and NTH will not intervene in disputes between students or
                instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon
                learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you
                suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our  <a href="contacts.html" target="_blank">Support Team </a>. We
                may request
                some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on NTH and
                use the Services. If you are younger than the required age, you may not set up an account,
                but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you enroll
                in courses that are appropriate for you. If we discover that you have created an account and
                you are younger than the required age for consent to use online services (for example, 13 in
                the Nepal), we will terminate your account. Under our  <a href="instructor_terms_and_condition.html"
                    target="_blank">Instructor Agreement</a>.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-heading">2. Course Enrollment and Access</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
                Under our <a href="instructor_terms_and_condition.html" target="_blank">Instructor Agreement </a>, when instructors approach to become as instructor on
                NTH,
                they grant NTH a license to offer a license to the course to students. This means that we
                have the right to sublicense the course to the students who enroll in the course. As a
                student, when you enroll in a course, whether it’s a free or paid course, you are getting from
                NTH a license to view the course via the NTH platform and Services, and NTH is the
                licensor of record. Courses are licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give
                you any right to resell the course in any manner (including by sharing account information
                with a purchaser or illegally downloading the course and sharing it on torrent sites).
            </p>
            <p>
                In legal, more complete terms, NTH grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-
                transferable license to access and view the courses and associated content for which you
                have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non- commercial, educational purposes
                through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions
                associated with a particular courses or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly
                prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent,
                share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer
                or use any course unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement
                signed by a NTH authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via
                any of our APIs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course.
                However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use courses at any point
                in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to a course due to
                legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course you enrolled in is the object of a copyright
                complaint, or if we determine its content violates our <a href="#">Trust &amp; Safety Guidelines </a>.
                The lifetime
                access is not applicable to add-on features and services associated with a course, for
                example translation captions of courses may be disabled by instructors at any time, and an
                instructor may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&amp;A services
                in association with a course. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not
                to the instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instructors may not grant licenses to their courses to student directly and any such direct
                license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-heading">3. Payments, Credits, and Refunds</h3>
            <p class="sample-text">
                When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. If you aren’t happy
                with your course, NTH offers a 10-day refund or credit for most course purchases.
            </p>
            <h4 >3.1 Pricing</h4><br/>
            <p>
                The prices of courses on NTH are determined based on the terms of the <a href="instructor_terms_and_condition.html" target="_blank"> Instructor
                Agreement</a> and our <a href="pricing_and_business_policy.html" target="_blank"> Pricing and Business
                    Promotions Policy </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We regularly run promotions and sales for our courses and certain courses are only
                available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to a course will
                be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the course (at checkout). Any price
                offered for a particular course may also be different when you are logged into your account
                from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our
                promotions are available to new users only.
            </p>
            <h4>3.2 Payments</h4><br/>
            <p>
                You agree to pay the fees for courses that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge
                your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as eSewa, direct debit,
                or mobile wallet) for those fees.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment
                method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the course you are
                enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification
                from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any course for which we have not
                received adequate payments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some cases, we may issue credits to your account. These credits will be automatically
                applied towards your next course purchase on our website. Credits may expire if not used
                within the specified period, and have no cash value.
            </p>
            <h3>3.3 Refunds and Credits</h3><br />
            <p>If the course you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 10
                days of your purchase of the course, that NTH credit/refund your account. We reserve the
                right to apply a credit or a refund, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our
                payment processing partners or the platform from which you purchased your course. No
                credit or refund is due to you if you request it after the 10-day guarantee time limit has
                passed. </p>
            <p> At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our credit/refund policy, we reserve the right
                to ban your account and to restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or
                disable your access to a course due to your violation of these Terms or our <a href="#"> Trust &amp; Safety
                Guidelines </a>, you will not be eligible to receive any credit or refund.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading">4. Content and Behavior Rules</h3>
        <p class="sample-text"> 
            You can only use NTH for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you
            post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other
            content you upload in line with our Trust &amp; Safety Guidelines and the law, and respect the
            intellectual property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major
            offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.
         </p>
         <h3 class="text-heading">5. NTH’s Rights to Content You Post</h3>
         <p class="sample-text"> You retain ownership of content you post to our platform, including your courses. We’re
             allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via
             advertising on other websites.</p>
        <h3 class="text-heading">6. Using NTH at Your Own Risk</h3>
        <p> If you enroll a course, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.</p>
        <p> By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive,
            indecent, or objectionable. NTH has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no
            liability for your access or enrollment in any course, to the extent permissible under
            applicable law. This also applies to any courses relating to health, wellness and physical
            exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these
            types of courses, and by enrolling in such courses, you choose to assume those risks
            voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full
            responsibility for the choices you make before, during and after your enrollment in a course.</p>
        <p> When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the
            types of personal information that you share. We do not control what students and
            instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should
            not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety.</p>
            <p>

        <h3 class="text-heading">8. Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            These Terms are like any other contract, and they have boring but important legal terms
            that protect us from the countless things that could happen and that clarify the legal
            relationship between us and you.
        </p>
        <h4>8.1 Binding Agreement</h4><br />
        <p> You agree that by registering, accessing or using our Services, you are agreeing to enter
            into a legally binding contract with NTH. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not register,
            access, or otherwise use any of our Services.</p>
            <p>If you are an instructor accepting these Terms and using our Services on behalf of a
                company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that
                you are authorized to do so.</p>
        <p>These Terms (including any agreements and policies linked from these Terms) constitute
            the entire agreement between you and us (which include, if you are an instructor,
            the <a href="instructor_terms_and_condition.html" target="_blank"> Instructor Agreement </a> and the <a href="pricing_and_business_policy.html" target="_blank"> Pricing and Business Promotions Policy </a>).</p>
    <p>If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by applicable law, then
        that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
        matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms will continue
        in effect.</p>
        <p>Even if we are delayed in exercising our rights or fail to exercise a right in one case, it
            doesn’t mean we waive our rights under these Terms, and we may decide to enforce them
            in the future. If we decide to waive any of our rights in a particular instance, it doesn’t mean
            we waive our rights generally or in the future.</p>
        <p>The following sections shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 2
            (Course Enrollment and Access), 5 (NTH’s Rights to Content You Post), 6 (Using NTH at
            Your Own Risk), 7 (NTH’s Rights), 8 (Miscellaneous Legal Terms), and 9 (Dispute
            Resolution).</p>
        <h4>8.2 Disclaimers</h4><br />
        <p> It may happen that our platform is down, either for planned maintenance or because
            something goes down with the site. It may happen that one of our instructors is making
            misleading statements in their course. It may also happen that we encounter security
            issues. These are just examples. You accept that you will not have any recourse against us
            in any of these types of cases where things don’t work out right. In legal, more complete
            language, the Services and their content are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.
            We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no representations or
            warranties about the suitability, reliability, availability, timeliness, security, lack of errors, or
            accuracy of the Services or their content, and expressly disclaim any warranties or
            conditions (express or implied), including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
            particular purpose, title, and non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners,
            and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results from use of the Services.
            Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some

            jurisdictions don’t allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above
            exclusions may not apply to you.</p>
            <p>We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and
                for any reason. Under no circumstances will NTH or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or
                agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of availability of
                such features.</p>
            <p>We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused
                by events beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural
                disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication outage; or government restrictions.</p>
        <h4>8.3 Limitation of Liability</h4><br />
        <p>There are risks inherent into using our Services. In legal, more complete language, to the
            extent permitted by law, we (and our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) will
            not be liable for any indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential damages (including loss
            of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities, or personal injury or death), whether
            arising in contract, warranty, tort, product liability, or otherwise, and even if we’ve been
            advised of the possibility of damages in advance. Our liability (and the liability of each of our
            group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any
            circumstance is limited to the greater of one thousand (1000) or the amount you have paid
            us in the twelve (12) months before the event giving rise to your claims. Some jurisdictions
            don’t allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so
            some of the above may not apply to you.</p>
        <h4>8.4 Indemnification</h4><br />
        <p>If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against
            you.</p>
        <h4>8.5 Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4><br />
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the <b class="bold-paragraph"> Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal </b>
            without reference to its choice or conflicts of law principles. Where the “Dispute Resolution”
            section below does not apply, you and we consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
            courts in Nepal.</p>
        <h4>8.6 Legal Actions and Notices</h4><br />
        <p>No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by
            either party more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.</p>
            <p>Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by
                registered or certified mail return receipt requested, or email.</p>
        <h4>8.7 Relationship between Us</h4><br />
        <p>
            You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor, or agency
            relationship exists between us.
        </p>
        <h4>8.8 No Assignment</h4><br />
        <p>
            You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under
            them). For example, if you registered an account as an employee of a company, your
            account cannot be transferred to another employee. We may assign these Terms (or the
            rights and licenses granted under them) to another company or person without restriction.
            Nothing in these Terms confers any right, benefit, or remedy on any third-party person or
            entity. You agree that your account is non-transferable and that all rights to your account
            and other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.
        </p>
        <h3 class="text-heading">9. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p class="sample-text">
            If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work
            and you live in the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, your options are to go to court or
            bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or
            participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b class="bold-paragraph">This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the Nepal.</b> Most
                disputes
            can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting
            our  <a href="contacts.html" target="_blank">Support Team</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Going to Arbitration</h4><br />
        <p>
            If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and NTH agree to resolve any claims related
            to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of
            the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated
            and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to
            go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court
            proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.
        </p>
         <h3 class="text-heading">10. Updating These Terms</h3>
         <p class="sample-text">
             From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or
             different practices (such as when we add new features), and NTH reserves the right in its
             sole discretion to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. If we make any
             material change, we will notify you using prominent means such as by email notice sent to
             the email address specified in your account or by posting a notice through our Services.
             Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall mean that you
            accept those changes. Any revised Terms shall supersede all previous Terms.
        </p>
