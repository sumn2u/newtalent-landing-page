            <p class="sample-text">
                We use tools like cookies, web beacons, analytics services, and advertising providers to
                gather the data listed above. Some of these tools offer you the ability to opt out of data

                As detailed in our <a href="#">Cookie Policy</a>,
                NTH and service providers acting on our behalf (like
                Google Analytics and third party advertisers) use server log files and automated data
                collection tools like cookies, tags, scripts, customized links, device or browser fingerprints,
                and web beacons (together, “ <b class="bold-paragraph"> Data Collection Tools </b>”) when you access and use
                    the
                Services. These Data Collection Tools automatically track and collect certain System Data
                and Usage Data (as detailed in Section 1) when you use the Services. In some cases, we
                tie data gathered through those Data Collection Tools to other data that we collect as
                described in this Privacy Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use cookies (small files that websites send to your device to uniquely identify your
                browser or device or to store data in your browser) for things like analyzing your use of the
                Services, personalizing your experience, making it easier to log into the Services, and
                recognizing you when you return. We use web beacons (small objects that allow us to
                measure the actions of visitors and users using the Services) for things like identifying
                whether a page was visited, identifying whether an email was opened, and advertising more
                efficiently by excluding current users from certain promotional messages or identifying the
                source of a new mobile app download.

            <h4>2.2 Analytics</h4><br />
            <p class="sample-text">
                We use third-party browser and mobile analytics services like Google Analytics on the

                visit, events within the Services, usage and performance data, and where the application
                was downloaded from. We use this data to improve the Services, better understand how the

                Services perform on different devices, and provide information that may be of interest to
                you.
            </p>
             <h4>2.3 Online Advertising</h4><br />

                tracking technologies on your computer, phone, or other device to collect data about your
                use of our Services, and may access those tracking technologies in order to serve these
                tailored advertisements to you. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these
                service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-
